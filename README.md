It builds. The .dll appears. The mod is in Content Manager, enabled, and the game loads without exception.
There is, however, no new button in the Unified UI panel, and when RCMM's hotkey (CTRL-SHIFT-A) is pressed, nothing happens.
But of course nothing happens. It is a hollow mod. 
I don't know whether to be glad of my progress, or sad I don't have a button yet.
Cheers for reading this.
